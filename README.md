# Alcuin
###REST API in PHP for the lazy ones

alcuin creates the database schema and the corresponding PHP classes for you. All it needs, is a JSON configuration file and a working PHP environment, and you're ready to go.

####What can alcuin do fo you?
Facing the problem, that you want an easy way to create a REST service, with user authentification but the initial inertia is too big, so that you use full-stack web application frameworks like Codeigniter. And other, also great frameworks like Laravel need the command like to be installed. But you don't have access to the command line, because you use a simple hosting service.

This is, where Alcuin steps in and saves the day.

Alcuin creates a REST service for you, without having to fiddle around with command lines statements and works without much technological dependencies.

### Hot to Start

There are only a few simple steps to take:
1. Download this repostory.
2. Adapt the `configuration.json` to match your settings and wishes
3. Upload the repository (including the edited `configuration.json`) to your webspace.
4. Execute `install.php`.
5. Have a beer and enjoy life. You have just setup a fully working REST service. You're awesome!
