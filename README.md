# Alcuin
####REST API for the rest of us

Alcuin creates the database schema and the corresponding PHP classes to provide a fully working REST API for you.
All it needs, is a YAML configuration file and a working PHP environment with composer and a MySQL database.

###What can Alcuin do fo you?
You want a REST API? You don't like thinking about foreign key constraints in your DB? You don't like facing the problem, that you want an easy way to create a REST service, with user authentification but the initial inertia is too big, so that you use full-stack web application frameworks like Codeigniter, but all you need is just a REST API?

This is the point where Alcuin steps in and saves the day.

Alcuin creates a REST service for you, without having to fiddle around with command lines statements.
